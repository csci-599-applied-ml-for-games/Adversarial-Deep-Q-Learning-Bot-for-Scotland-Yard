# To find the routes available at location 100, set routes=locToRoutes[100].
# routes[n][0] is one of the locations that location 100 can connect to,
# and routes[n][1] is a tuple of the methods that can be used to reach
# that location.  So for example:
#
#   routes = locToRoutes[100]
#   possible_moves = []
#   for route in routes:
#      if (has_taxi() and TAXI in route[1]) or
#         (has_bus() and BUS in route[1]) or
#         (has_underground() and UNDERGROUND in route[1]) or
#         has_black():
#      possible_moves.append(route[0])
#
# This routine would create a list of all possible locations that the
# player could move to, assuming has_taxi() and friend are properly
# defined.


# Note for proofreading: the algorithm for creating this map was (roughly) to look
# for first taxi routes (clockwise from the route going upward), then bus routes
# and underground routes.
#
# locToRoutes is generated from this by adding the (invisible) black ticket transports
# to all routes in _locToRoutesPartial.
